## How to install it?
Duplicate this repository and edit the *config.php* file with your variables (everything is commented). Don't forget to set the blog link to the final URL of your blog

In the /assets/img folder, change the icon.png file to your favicon, and the og.png file by the wide-size image (1200x630) that you want to be displayed when you share a link from your blog

## How to write posts?
Create a markdown file in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" (2023-09-27) and drop it in the /posts folder, the website will display it automatically. Start your file with any title you want (# Title) then fly, you're free!

## How to write pages?
Create a markdown file named as you want by replacing spaces by dashes (About Me --> About-me) and drop it in the /pages folder
