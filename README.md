# Tiny Blog Engine

The Tiny Blog Engine is a lightweight and highly customizable blog engine that empowers you to create and modify your own blogging platform with ease.

- **Lightweight**: The entire engine is only 230kb in size.
- **Dark & Light Mode**: Enjoy the convenience of built-in dark and light modes.
- **Customization**: Easily customize the colors, fonts, language to match your preferences.
- **Simple Deployment**: Requires only FTP access for deployment (and a server that supports PHP, should be easy to find in 2023)
- **Comments & Interactions**: See below
- **RSS2 Support**: Keeps your readers updated with RSS2 feed compatibility.
- **GDPR Compliant**: The engine respects your privacy by not relying on external dependencies.

## Comment & Interactions

The config.php file provides different comments / reactions systems that you can decide to activate:

- **Kudos**: the simplest system, it allows your user to leave a "like" on your posts without hassle. Same has the "clap" on Medium
- **Webmention.io**: Supported thanks to [this script](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js/) integration. You will have to provide both the webmention script & pingback script links ([see this page](https://webmention.io/settings))
- **Commento.io**: You can enable [commento.io](commento.io/) system by providing the URL set in your administration pannel 

## Problems on PHP 8 on some systems

Ensure you have php8.1-xml and php8.1-mbstring installed
